Why did he have to break my heart?  Metaphorically or otherwise!

I know that time will help, but right now I am so miserable! \n Well.. take some positive stock in what you're feeling. That emotional pain you're feeling from your broken heart--not only is it natural, but it's believed to be part of the survival instinct.

Watching highlights of him playing for Monaco, Juventus, Barcelona, even the New York Red Bulls... exciting. \n Oh really? I've recently gotten into American football, but I think you're talking about soccer? Is that right? \n Yeah, association football. Sorry, I should have specified!

I'll bet many players look up to him. What else can you tell me about Thierry Henry?", "answer": ["While he was runner-up in some accolades, he did get awarded PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the FWA Footballer of the year three times.
